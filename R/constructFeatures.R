#' Feature construction
#'
#' Helper function to make a data frame ready for training/validation/testing
#' from a bsseq object that contains the CpG/DNA features for the model
#'
#' @param bs a \code{BSseq} object
#' @param sample which sample to construct features for; default is 1, the
#' first sample.
#' @param minCov the minimum coverage, below which values will be set to NA.
#' Default is 10.
#' @param sampleAvg boolean of whether to not to include the sample average
#' as a feature. Default is TRUE.
#' @param neighbMeth boolean of whether or not to include nearest non-missing
#' neighboring CpG methylation values. Default is TRUE.
#' @param neighbDist boolean of whether or not to include nearest non-missing
#' neighboring CpG distances. Default is TRUE.
#' @param featureBEDs optional named list of paths to BED files to be included
#' as features in the model. Names are used as the feature name;
#' e.g. list(chromState = "chromatinStates.bed")
#' @return a data.frame, each row is a CpG; first column is the actual beta
#' value, subsequent columns are features
